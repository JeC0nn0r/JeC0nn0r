<h2>👋 Hello! I'm Connor!</h2>

- 👨‍🎓 I am a member of Champlain College's Class of 2027 studying Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics as a Double Major.
- 💼 I am also currently employed part-time by the Leahy Center for Digital Investigation as a Network Systems Engineer.
- 📝 I'm currently learning wireless network security & introductory digital forensics.
- 🦀 My favorite food is any type of whole crab I can pick apart, but creamed chipped beef is a close second!
