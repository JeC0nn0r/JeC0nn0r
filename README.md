<h2>👋 Hello! I'm Connor!</h2>

- 👨‍🎓 I am a member of Champlain College's Class of 2026 studying Computer Networking and Cybersecurity.
- 💼 I am also currently employed part-time by the Leahy Center for Digital Investigation as the team Supervisor for Network System Engineers.
- 📝 I'm currently learning database security and elementary ethical hacking / penetration testing!
- 🦀 My favorite food is any type of whole crab I can pick apart, but creamed chipped beef is a close second!
